          <h3>Understanding the process of chunking</h3>
          <hr />

          <p>
            Chunking is a process of splitting large files into smaller unitds
            of files called chunks. In some applications, such as a remote data
            compression, data synchronizatuin and data duplication. Chunking is
            important because it determines the duplicate detection performance
            of the system. Chunk file is a small and handy application designed
            to help you split large into pieces of a set size, so you can easily
            transfer them without any loss of data.

          <h3>What is ChunkIT?</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            ChunkIt is a free web-based platform that splits large or heavy CSV
            and JSON files. When a user uploads a large file of up to 250MB to
            our platform, our Python Panda modules begin authenticating the
            files to determine if they are CSV or JSON. If the files are none of
            these determined inputs or bigger than the size, our platform would
            not accept them, but if the data input is true, it accepts the files
            after determining the state, and the process of splitting commences
            through the help of the panda modules. The data is stacked in
            smaller files querying the number of parts or the size the user
            needs to split it. This is done through the use of logic. When the
            process of splitting is completed, the result is zipped using shutil
            modules, ready for the user to download.

            Users can view saved files, download chunked files, download the
            original file and delete some or all saved files by visiting the
            library page.

          <h3>Getting started</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            For a user to get started with using the chunking feature of the
            platform, they need to create an account by registering with their
            email address to become an authenticated user. This means that an
            unauthenticated user can not use the chunking feature. However, the
            unauthenticated user can interact with the platform's documentation
            by accessing the documentations tab in the header and footer
            sections. They can also go through the platform's landing page and
            FAQ section to learn more about its features.

          <h3>How to use ChunkIT</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Upon creating an account, the user is redirected to the user
            dashboard where they can start uploading files they want to process.
            They choose the option to upload a new file, and a screen appears
            that allows them to upload a file. The platform currently supports
            chunking JSON and CSV files; however, more file formats will be
            supported in future versions. The user then uploads their file by
            either dragging and dropping it on the screen, or browsing through
            their device's file system. The platform can only accept files up to
            250 MB in size and are also of the correct format, CSV or JSON. Once
            the file uploaded by the user satisfies the requirements, the user
            can choose the size of the chunk files they require. The size of the
            chunk should not be above the original file size. If it is, the file
            will not be chunked. If the size of the chunk is within the
            acceptable range, the user is directed to a screen where they can
            download a zipped file containing the chunked file. The user can
            also choose to download the files later, and their files are saved
            on the dashboard.

          <p>
            In this modal you can upload the files you want to chunk. To start
            chunking, this is the step by step process you should take; <br />
            First click the “upload file” button <br />
            Next select files from your local device, github or any other
            storage platform you use <br />
            Next drop the selected file inside the box in the upload file modal
            <br />
            Next click the number of chunks you want your file to be and start
            chunking.
