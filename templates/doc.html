                    Chunking is a process of splitting large files into smaller unitds
                    of files called chunks. In some applications, such as a remote
                    data compression, data synchronizatuin and data duplication.
                    Chunking is important because it determines the duplicate
                    detection performance of the system. Chunk file is a small and
                    handy application designed to help you split large into pieces of
                    a set size, so you can easily transfer them without any loss of
                    data.

                    ChunkIt is a free web-based platform that splits large or heavy
                    CSV and JSON files. When a user uploads a large file of up to
                    250MB to our platform, our Python Panda modules begin
                    authenticating the files to determine if they are CSV or JSON. If
                    the files are none of these determined inputs or bigger than the
                    size, our platform would not accept them, but if the data input is
                    true, it accepts the files after determining the state, and the
                    process of splitting commences through the help of the panda
                    modules. The data is stacked in smaller files querying the number
                    of parts or the size the user needs to split it. This is done
                    through the use of logic. When the process of splitting is
                    completed, the result is zipped using shutil modules, ready for
                    the user to download.

                    For a user to get started with using the chunking feature of the
                    platform, they need to create an account by registering with their
                    email address to become an authenticated user. This means that an
                    unauthenticated user can not use the chunking feature. However,
                    the unauthenticated user can interact with the platform's
                    documentation by accessing the documentations tab in the header
                    and footer sections. They can also go through the platform's
                    landing page and FAQ section to learn more about its features.

                    Upon creating an account, the user is redirected to the user
                    dashboard where they can start uploading files they want to
                    process. They choose the option to upload a new file, and a screen
                    appears that allows them to upload a file. The platform currently
                    supports chunking JSON and CSV files; however, more file formats
                    will be supported in future versions. The user then uploads their
                    file by either dragging and dropping it on the screen, or browsing
                    through their device's file system. The platform can only accept
                    files up to 250 MB in size and are also of the correct format, CSV
                    or JSON. Once the file uploaded by the user satisfies the
                    requirements, the user can choose the size of the chunk files they
                    require. The size of the chunk should not be above the original
                    file size. If it is, the file will not be chunked. If the size of
                    the chunk is within the acceptable range, the user is directed to
                    a screen where they can download a zipped file containing the
                    chunked file. The user can also choose to download the files
                    later, and their files are saved on the dashboard.
